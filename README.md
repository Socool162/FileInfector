Folder Bai 3 Virus_Submit: have code virus (infectFile_Success.asm) and file virus compiled (infectFile_Success.exe). 

Folder test: just have file 32bit, GUI, .sys to test. You can check their sections (.infect) in CFF Explorer. 

Note:

- Save folder test in C:\ to run file exe. I had compiled C:\test in code, so just run it to infect file in C:\test.
